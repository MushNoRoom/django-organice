Django Organice
===============

All-in-one collaboration solution for non-profit organizations, sports clubs or small to medium-sized businesses.
Nice, very nice, http://organice.io

Features
========

django Organice is a nice way to run a collaboration platform, an intranet, and websites for your business.
It's a compilation of the best Django packages, preconfigured for getting you started quickly. Being powered by
the well-known `Django Web framework <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_ it's a safe choice for your IT investment
providing an easily extensible architecture.

Primary goal of the software is to provide an absolutely intuitive, consistent user experience. Because in fast-paced,
flexible, probably small-margin businesses you don't have the time to invest in training of your staff. We build on
promising, reliable Django components, and rather invest in those projects than build source code here. We expect to
continually tune the compilation to keep the source footprint small, keeping the project lean and responsive.
